== ANNOUNCEMENTS ==

  Gmail appears to be stable again which means that Minimalist will be more stable as well.
  
  Questions about permissions? See PERMISSIONS section below.

  
== WHAT DOES IT DO? ==

  It is a personalized solution for those who are tired of useless and distracting elements in the Gmail interface.
  It removes as much or as little as you want. It also adds functionality if you so choose.
  Look around the options page to see what it does first hand. Link below.


== PERMISSIONS ==

  Learn more about Chrome Extension permissions here: http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=186213
  If you look as the permissions required by similar extensions in the Web Store, you will see that they are exactly the same
  so before you make assumptions based on two short and broad statements, please read the following:

 == "tabs"
  * This permissions results in the "This extensions can access your browsing history" warning.
  * I *NEVER* access your browsing history.
  * I need this permission to open tabs. I use this to open the options page on major updates.
  * This permission is also used to refresh the Gmail tab when you save your settings.
 == "bookmarks"
  * This permission results in the "This item can access your bookmars" warning.
  * I *NEVER* access, read, modify, store, or transmit any of bookmarks.
  * I need this permission to create a bookmark that is used to sync settings accross computers.
 == "http://*/*", "https://*/*"
  * This permission results in the "This extension can access your data on all websites" warning.
  * I *NEVER* access, read, store, or transmit your personal data.
  * I need this permission to run user scripts behind specific pages in the browser.
  * These scripts inject Javascript and CSS into Gmail to enhance functionality and hide elements
  * The reason I ask for permissions to all pages and not just Gmail is because of my open in Gmail feature
    which replaces all "mailto:" links in websites with a script that opens clickable email addresses in Gmail.
